## Description
This is my first time participating in AoC and I wanted to learn a new language that isn't in anyway related to JS or JS frameworks (I'm so tired of them). 

Lua has always been a really pretty language with a weird indexing convention. I sort of used it before to configure Neovim-- but I never really understood it. I'm aiming to learn Lua for future gamedev and embedded code prospects!
