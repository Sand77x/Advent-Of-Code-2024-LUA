# Advent of Code 2024 ..with Lua!
__Finished:__ N/A
__Days Completed__: N/A     
## Description
This is my first time participating in AoC and I wanted to learn a new language that isn't in anyway related to JS or JS frameworks (I'm so tired of them). 

Lua has always been a really pretty language with a weird indexing convention. I sort of used it before to configure Neovim-- but I never really understood it. I'm aiming to learn Lua for future gamedev and embedded code prospects!

Some folders also have other languages that I wanted to try but all days should have Lua code at least. It's so much fun :D
